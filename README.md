# sInterface

A user interface for World of Warcraft

## About

sInterface is an opinionated replacement for the standard BlizzardUI. Reductionism is the goal. Fewer, smaller elements; frames that show when required; key information in the spotlight.

There is no in-game configuration, customising your installation requires modifying lua files. sInterface does not use character profilesâ€”configuration is shared between all characters without setup..
