# sInterface

A user interface for World of Warcraft

## About

sInterface is an opinionated replacement for the standard BlizzardUI. Reductionism is the goal. Fewer, smaller elements; frames that show when required; key information in the spotlight.

Supported configuration is minimal, and only available by editing lua files. sInterface has no concept of character profiles, configuration is shared between all characters without any setup.


## Supporting

Opening pull requests and issues on GitHub is the simplest way to support the project.
